# Proposed GPU-SVM-kNN with optimized OpenCL kernel

This is the algorithm proposed in paper, "On-Body Wearable Device Localization with a Fast and Memory Efficient SVM-kNN using GPUs".
The algorithm combines kNN with a SVM classifier and contains a optimized OpenCL kernel for radixsort-based k nearest neighbor method.
